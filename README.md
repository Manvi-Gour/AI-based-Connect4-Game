**Description:**
Connect Four is a two players game which takes place on a 7x6 rectangular board placed vertically between them. One player has 21 yellow coins and the other 21 red coins. Each player can drop a coin from the top of the board in one of the seven columns; the coin falls down and fills the lower unoccupied square. Of course, a player cannot drop a coin in a certain column if it's already full (i.e., it already contains six coins).
